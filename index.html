                    The Warriors were founded in 1946 as the Philadelphia Warriors, a charter member of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_Association_of_America'>Basketball Association of
                        America.</a> They were owned by Peter A. Tyrrell, who also owned the Philadelphia Rockets of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Hockey_League'>American Hockey League</a>.

                    <br><br>
                    Tyrrell hired <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Gottlieb'>Eddie Gottlieb</a>, a longtime
                    basketball promoter in the Philadelphia area, as coach and general manager. The owners named the team
                    after the Philadelphia Warriors, an old basketball team who played in the American Basketball League in
                    1925.
                    Led by early scoring sensation <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Fulks'>Joe Fulks</a>, the team

                    which was created by a 1949 merger, officially recognizes that as its own first championship. Gottlieb
                    bought the team in 1951.
                    <br><br>
                    The Warriors won its next championship in Philadelphia in the 1955–56 season, defeating the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Wayne_Pistons'>Fort Wayne Pistons</a> four games to one.
                    The Warrior stars of this era were future Hall of Famers Paul Arizin, Tom Gola and Neil Johnston.

                    "home" game played on a neutral court in Hershey, Pennsylvania, Chamberlain scored <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilt_Chamberlain%27s_100-point_game'>100 points</a> against the
                    <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks'>New York Knicks</a>, a single-game record the
                    NBA ranks among its finest moments.

                    In 1962, Franklin Mieuli purchased the majority shares of the team and relocated the franchise to the
                    San Francisco Bay Area, renaming them the San Francisco Warriors. The Warriors played most of their home
                    games at the Cow Palace in Daly City (the facility lies just south of the San Francisco city limits)
                    from 1962 to 1964 and the San Francisco Civic Auditorium from 1964 to 1966, though occasionally playing
                    home games in nearby cities such as Oakland and San Jose.
                    <br><br>
                    Prior to the 1963–64 NBA season, the Warriors drafted big man Nate Thurmond to go along with
                    Chamberlain. The Warriors won the Western Division crown that season, but lost the 1964 NBA Finals to
                    the Boston Celtics, four games to one. In the 1964–65 season, the Warriors traded Chamberlain to the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers'>Philadelphia 76ers</a> for Connie Dierking,
                    Lee Shaffer, Paul Neumann and $150,000 and won only 17 games.

                    <hr>
                    In 1965, they drafted <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Barry'>Rick Barry </a>in the first
                    round who went on to become NBA Rookie of the Year that season and then led the Warriors to the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967_NBA_Finals'>NBA Finals</a> in the 1966–67 season, losing
                    (four games to two) to Chamberlain's new team that had replaced the Warriors in Philadelphia, the 76ers.
                    <br><br>
                    Angered by management's failure to pay him certain incentive bonuses he felt were due him, Barry sat out
                    the 1967–68 season and signed with the Oakland Oaks of the rival American Basketball Association for the
                    following year, but after four seasons in the ABA rejoined the Warriors in 1972. During Barry's absence,
                    the Warriors were no longer title contenders, and the mantle of leadership fell to Thurmond, Jeff
                    Mullins and Rudy LaRusso. They began scheduling more home games in Oakland with the opening of the
                    Oakland Coliseum Arena in 1966 and the 1970–71 season would be the team's last as the San Francisco
                    Warriors.

                    The franchise adopted its brand name Golden State Warriors prior to the 1971–72 season, to suggest that
                    the team represented the entire state of California. Almost all home games were played in Oakland that
                    season; six were played in San Diego, but none in San Francisco or Daly City. Oakland Arena became the
                    team's exclusive home court in 1971.
                    <br><br>
                    The Warriors made the playoffs from 1971 to 1977 except in 1974, and won their first NBA championship on
                    the West Coast in 1974–75. In what many consider the biggest upset in NBA history, Golden State not only
                    defeated the heavily favored <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Bullets'>Washington
                        Bullets</a> but humiliated them in a four-game sweep. That team was coached by former Warrior <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Attles'>Al Attles</a>, and led on the court by Rick Barry and
                    Jamaal Wilkes. Barry was named Finals MVP.
                    <br><br>
                    At 59–23, the Warriors had the league's best record during the 1975–76 season. They were upset, however,
                    by the 42–40 Phoenix Suns in seven games in the Western Conference Finals.

                        1978–1985: A period of struggles
                    </h2>
                    <hr>
                    Due of the loss of key players such as Barry, Wilkes and Thurmond to trades and retirements, the
                    Warriors struggled to put a competitive team on the court from 1978 to 1987 after being one of the NBA's
                    dominant teams in the 1960s and most of the 1970s. Through the NBA draft, however, they acquired some
                    players such as high-scoring forward <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purvis_Short'>Purvis
                        Short</a> (1978), former Purdue center <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Barry_Carroll'>Joe Barry Carroll</a> (1980) and center <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Parish'>Robert Parish</a> (1976), who
                    was traded to the Boston Celtics in 1980 along with the draft pick that would become Kevin McHale for
                    the pick used to draft Carroll.
                    <br><br>
                    In 1983, the Warriors matched the New York Knicks' offer for free-agent Bernard King, but, unable to pay
                    his high salary, quickly traded him to the Knicks for guard Micheal Ray Richardson, whom they soon
                    shipped to New Jersey in exchange for former Georgetown Hoya point guard <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleepy_Floyd'>Eric "Sleepy" Floyd</a>, and
                    journeyman forward <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Johnson'>Mickey Johnson</a>. Floyd once scored 29 points for the Warriors in the fourth quarter of
                    a playoff game against the Lakers, though he was later traded to the Houston Rockets.
                    <br><br>
                    The departure of these players for various reasons symbolized the franchise's futility during this
                    period, as head coach Attles moved up to the front office as general manager in 1980 and the team made
                    several coaching changes. New owners Jim Fitzgerald and Dan Finane finally managed to return the team to
                    respectability by hiring former <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers'>Cleveland Cavaliers</a> head coach George Karl as head coach in 1986 after
                    selecting St. John's small forward <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Mullin_(basketball)'>Chris Mullin</a> in the 1985 NBA draft.

                        1985–1997: The Chris Mullin era
                    </h2>
                    <hr>
                    After a subpar stretch in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the team had a brief resurgence under coach Karl, culminating
                    in a 1987 Western Conference Semifinal match against <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Johnson'>Magic Johnson</a> and the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers'>Los Angeles Lakers</a> that is still shown on TV
                    in the NBA's Greatest Games series. The second-half performance by the Warriors' All-Star point guard Sleepy Floyd still
                    stands as the NBA playoff record for points scored in a quarter (29) and in a half (39). His six consecutive field goals
                    in the fourth quarter led to a 51-point finish for him and a victory for the Warriors.
                    <br><br>
                    The "Sleepy Floyd game" catalyzed increased interest in the NBA in the Bay Area; so did new coach Don Nelson, who
                    engineered a string of wins in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the high-scoring trio of point guard <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hardaway'>Tim Hardaway</a>,
                    guard Mitch Richmond and forward Chris Mullin. Collectively known as "Run TMC" after the rap group Run-D.M.C., the trio
                    stayed together for just two seasons and won only one playoff series. Nelson sent Richmond to the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Kings'>Sacramento Kings</a> for
                    rookie power forward Billy Owens, a promising young front-court player meant to complement the coach's run-and-gun
                    system. Nelson had been brought to the Warriors from the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks'>Milwaukee Bucks</a> by Jim Fitzgerald, who co-owned the team from
                    1986 and 1995 with Dan Finnane. In 1993–94, with first-round draft pick and Rookie of the Year power forward Chris
                    Webber playing with off-guard Latrell Sprewell, the Warriors made the playoffs.
                    <br><br>
                    At the start of the next season, however, a rift formed between Webber and Sprewell on the one hand and Nelson on the
                    other. All three soon left the team, and the organization went into a tailspin. The 1994–95 season was the first under
                    new team owner Chris Cohan, who had bought out Fitzgerald and Finnane. The Warriors selected power forward prospect Joe
                    Smith as their first overall draft pick in 1995 and hired Rick Adelman as the new head coach. They sent Tim Hardaway and
                    Chris Gatling to the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat'>Miami Heat</a> for Kevin Willis and Bimbo Coles midway through the 1995–96 season, and ended up with a
                    36–46 record, three wins short of making the playoffs. While their home court, the Oakland Coliseum Arena, was being
                    extensively renovated, the 1996–97 Warriors played their home games in the San Jose Arena and struggled to a 30–52
                    finish. Following the season, Mullin was traded to the Indiana Pacers in exchange for Erick Dampier and Duane
                    Ferrell.

                    <hr>
                    The Warriors chose future superstar point guard <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry'>Stephen Curry</a> of Davidson College with the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft. During the 2009 off-season, Warrior ownership declined to renew the contract of general manager Chris Mullin. Larry Riley, Nelson's longtime assistant coach, was promoted in his place; Riley drafted Curry and traded Jamal Crawford to the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks'>Atlanta Hawks</a> for Acie Law and Speedy Claxton.
                    <br><br>
                    The Warriors had another injury-prone year in 2009–10 as they were consistently unable to field their ideal starting lineup.
                    In November, a malcontented Stephen Jackson and seldom-used Acie Law were traded to the Charlotte Bobcats for Raja Bell (out for the season with an injury) and Vladimir Radmanovic.
                    Four days later, they signed center Chris Hunter.
                    Starting in January 2010, they issued multiple 10-day contracts, most notably to power forward Anthony Tolliver from the Idaho Stampede.
                    Due to their multiple injuries, they were granted an exception allowing them to sign Reggie Williams from the Sioux Falls Skyforce to a 10-day contract on March 2.
                    They eventually waived the injured Bell to sign Williams for the rest of the year and finished the season 26–56, failing to make the playoffs.
                    Curry finished second in the NBA Rookie of the Year voting to the Sacramento Kings' Tyreke Evans and was named to the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Rookie_First_Team'>NBA All-Rookie First Team</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    The Warriors won 36 games and failed to make the playoffs in 2010–11.
                    The team broke a franchise record with 21 made three-pointers in a win against the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Magic'>Orlando Magic</a>.
                    In February 2011, the Warriors traded Brandan Wright and Dan Gadzuric for Troy Murphy and a 2012 second-round pick that was used on Draymond Green.
                    On February 27, Murphy and the Warriors reached a buyout agreement and he was waived.
                    In April 2011, Dorell Wright made a franchise record of 184 three-pointers in a season in a home win versus Los Angeles Lakers, surpassing Richardson's 183 in 2005–06.
                    In a win against the Portland Trail Blazers, Wright then broke another NBA record, becoming the first player to have scored more points in his seventh season than in all his first six seasons combined.
                    Wright ended the season with the most three-pointers made in the NBA that season with 194, as well as the most three-pointers attempted with 516; each mark set a new Warriors franchise record.
                    Following the season, Curry received the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Sportsmanship_Award'>NBA Sportsmanship Award</a>.
                    Coach Smart was dismissed on April 27, 2011 due to the change in ownership.
                    Seventeen-year NBA veteran and former ABC and ESPN commentator Mark Jackson replaced Smart as head coach on June 6.

                    The Warriors selected future All-Star shooting guard <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson'>Klay Thompson</a> with the 11th pick in the 2011 NBA Draft.
                    However, the team did not improve in the 2011–12 NBA season under coach Jackson, finishing the lockout-shortened season with a 23–43 record (13th in the conference) and again failing to make the playoffs.
                    Due to the 2011 NBA lockout, Jackson could not establish his system in training camp.
                    Hindered by several injuries to key players, the team then entered into another chaotic rebuilding phase.
                    Team leader Monta Ellis was traded in mid-March 2012, along with Kwame Brown and Ekpe Udoh, to the Milwaukee Bucks for center Andrew Bogut (out injured for the season) and former Warrior small forward Stephen Jackson, who without playing a game for the Warriors was quickly traded to the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs'>San Antonio Spurs</a> for Richard Jefferson and a conditional first-round pick on March 15.
                    These moves saw the rise of Stephen Curry and David Lee to team co-captains, and saw Thompson move into a starting role.
                    However, Curry suffered a series of ankle and foot-related injuries that limited him to 26 regular-season games.

                    Jackson was fired as coach on May 6, 2014, despite a unanimous declaration of support from his players and a three-year 121–109 (.526) record that marked a major turnaround and placed him fourth on the franchise's all-time wins list, trailing Alvin Attles (557), Don Nelson (422) and Eddie Gottlieb (263).
                    Over the 17 years before Jackson took the helm in 2011, the franchise had averaged 30.2 wins per season and made the playoffs only once.
                    Jackson became just the third Warriors head coach to notch at least 50 wins in a season, joining Nelson and Attles, who both hit the mark twice.
                    <br><br>
                    On May 14, 2014, the Golden State Warriors signed <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr'>Steve Kerr</a> to a reported five-year, $25 million deal to become the team's new head coach.
                    It was the first head-coach job for Kerr, 48, a five-time NBA champion guard who set an all-time career record for accuracy in three-point shooting (.454).
                    Kerr had served as president and general manager for the Phoenix Suns basketball team from 2007 to 2010, and had recently been working as an NBA broadcast analyst for Turner Network Television (TNT).
                    The Warriors also signed point guard <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_Livingston'>Shaun Livingston</a> and guard Leandro Barbosa during the off-season.
                    <br><br>
                    The Warriors completed the 2014–2015 regular season with a league-best record of 67–15, setting a Warriors record for wins.
                    The team finished with a home record of 39–2, second-best in NBA history.
                    The team ranked first in defensive efficiency for the season and second in offensive efficiency, barely missing the mark that the Julius Erving-led Sixers achieved by being first in both offensive and defensive efficiency.
                    On May 4, Stephen Curry was named the 2014–15 <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award'>NBA Most Valuable Player</a>, the first Warrior since Wilt Chamberlain in 1960.
                    <br><br>
                    The Warriors swept the New Orleans Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs, defeated Memphis Grizzlies in six games in the second round, and dispatched Houston Rockets in five games in the Western Conference Finals. The Warriors advanced to their first NBA Finals since 1975.
                    The team's opponent was the Cleveland Cavaliers, who would later go on to face the Warriors in each of the next three consecutive NBA Finals.
                    After Golden State fell behind 2–1 in the series, Kerr gave swingman Andre Iguodala his first start of the season, replacing center Andrew Bogut in Game 4.
                    The Warriors' small lineup (which came to be known as the Death Lineup) helped turn the series around. The Warriors defeated the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers'>Cavaliers</a> in six games, and Iguodala was named Finals MVP.
                    Kerr became the first rookie coach to win a title since Pat Riley in 1981–82.

                    The Warriors won three of the first four games of the 2016 NBA Finals, but the Cavaliers made a comeback to tie the series at three wins apiece.
                    Draymond Green was suspended for Game Five of the series, and Curry was ejected from Game Six.
                    In Game Seven, the Warriors lost the series on their home court, earning the distinction of becoming the first team to lose the NBA Finals after having led three games to one.

                    July 2016 featured a series of significant player transactions.

                    On July 7, Durant signed his contract, which gave the Warriors a fourth All-NBA player on their team.
                    The Durant signing made the Warriors prohibitive favorites to win the 2017 NBA championship, according to oddsmakers.
                    On July 9, 2016, free-agent forward Harrison Barnes signed with the Dallas Mavericks.
                    Centers Festus Ezeli and Marreese Speights left the Warriors for other teams, as did guard Leandro Barbosa.
                    Center Andrew Bogut was traded, along with a future second-round pick, to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for a future conditional second-round pick.
                    Veteran power forward David West signed with the Warriors, as did free-agent center Zaza Pachulia.

                    The Warriors posted many notable achievements during the 2016–17 regular season.
                    On November 7, 2016, Stephen Curry set the NBA record for most 3-pointers in a game with 13, in a 116–106 win over the Pelicans.
                    On December 5, 2016, Klay Thompson scored 60 points in 29 minutes, in a 142–106 victory over the Pacers.
                    In doing so, Thompson became the first player in NBA history to score 60 or more points in fewer than 30 minutes of playing time.
                    Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson were all named to the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_NBA_All-Star_Game'>2017 NBA All-Star Game</a>, making the Warriors only the eighth team in NBA history to have four All-Stars.
                    On February 10, 2017, Draymond Green recorded a triple-double with 12 rebounds, 10 assists, and 10 steals, becoming the first player in NBA history to post a triple-double with fewer than 10 points.
                    On March 2, 2017, the Warriors' streak for most games without back-to-back losses ended at 146 with a 94–87 loss to the Chicago Bulls.
                    The streak eclipsed the previous record of 95 held by the Utah Jazz.
                    <br><br>
                    The Warriors earned home-court advantage throughout the 2017 playoffs, thanks to a 2016–17 regular season record of 67–15.
                    They were the first team in NBA playoff history to start the playoffs 12–0, defeating the Trail Blazers, the Jazz, and the Spurs in consecutive series.
                    The 2017 Finals once again pitted the Warriors against the Cavaliers, becoming the first time in NBA history that two teams met in the Finals for three consecutive years.
                    The Warriors won the championship after going 4–1 in the Finals, and their 16–1 playoff record garnered the best winning percentage (.941) in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs'>NBA playoffs</a> history.

                        Downfall
                    </h2>
                    <hr>
                    After the Finals loss to Toronto, during which Durant tore his Achilles and Thompson tore his ACL, Durant chose to sign a four-year deal with the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets'>Brooklyn Nets</a>.
                    In order to not lose Durant for nothing, the Warriors sent Durant along with a protected first round round pick (2020) to the Nets in exchange for D'Angelo Russell in a two way sign-and-trade.
                    The sign-and-trade triggered a hard cap for the Warriors, who were forced to trade Iguodala's $17 million salary to the Memphis Grizzlies while also giving them a top 4 protected 2024 first round pick as incentive.
                    During that same off-season, Stephen Curry's wife Ayesha Curry publicly expressed her dissatisfaction with the amount of male attention she receives relative to the female attention received by her husband, a grievance which purportedly undermined the Warriors' team chemistry.
                    The Warriors played their first regular season game at the Chase Center on October 24, 2019, in a 141–122 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.
                    During their very next home game, on October 30 against the Phoenix Suns, Curry broke his hand in a collision, requiring surgery that was expected to keep him out of action for at least 3 months.
                    This, along with Thompson's injury rehab keeping him out the entire year, caused the Warriors to quickly spiral into the worst record in the NBA.
                    However, they saw second round pick Eric Paschall, two-way player Damion Lee, and training camp pickup <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquese_Chriss'>Marquese Chriss</a> establish themselves as rotation players.
                    At the trade deadline, the Warriors traded Russell, 2018 first round pick Jacob Evans, and recent acquisition Omari Spellman to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Andrew Wiggins, a top 3 protected first round pick, and a second round pick.
                    Curry returned for one game on March 5 before the season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
                    The Warriors were not one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble on June 4, which ended their 2019–20 season with a league-worst record of 15–50.
